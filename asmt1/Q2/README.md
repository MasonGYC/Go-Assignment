## External package
`log` : used for output logging and debugging purpose.

## Implementation

### Message
Message is defined to be a struct with 4 fields: 
 
- `sender_id`: `int`, the id of the sender machine
- `message_type`: `string`, the type of the message, including:  
 	- `SYNC` Coordinator sync data with worker.  
    - `ELECT` A node elect itself to be the new coordinator.  
	- `ACK` A node refuse one's self-elect request.   
	- `VICTORY` A node broadcast that it is the now coordinator. 
	- `STOP` To stop a goroutine.     
- `message`: `any`, usually a sentence about the content, which is readable by human.
- `timestamp`: `time.Time`, the physical clock of the message. currently not used in the program.

### Node
Each node has a state, a role, 4 channels. 
- Role:
    - `WORKER` 
    - `COORDINATOR`
- State:
    - `NORMAL` node performs normal work, not during election
	- `SELF_ELECTING` node is sending self-electing messages
	- `BROADCATING` new coordinator broadcasting victory
	- `DOWN` node fails
- Channels:
	- `ch_sync` for SYNC message  
	- `ch_elect` for ELECT, ACK, VICTORY message  
	- `ch_stop_elect` for STOP mesage to stop self_elect() or broadcast_victory()  
	- `ch_role_switch` for STOP mesage to switch between `COORDINATOR` and `WORKER`   

### Synchonization and Election
- **Synchonization**  
 If Coordinator alive, send SYNC message at certain interval to Worker. If Worker receives SYNC message, update its data; if not for a timeout, start a election to elect itself as the Coordinator.

- **Election by bully algorithm**  
 A node sends ELECT message to nodes with higher ids. If receives ACK or STOP, go back to NORMAL state and stops election. If not for a certain time, broadcasts its victory to all. After broadcasting, switch role to Coordinator and start sending SYNC messages.

### Failure Implementation
 Set node state to `DOWN` and stop preocessing received message,sending message, and electing. It can still receive messages but won't take care of it.

 For implementation details, refer to the code.

## Output
The `logs.txt` in each folder contains the sample outputs with 3 nodes, and the coordinator fails after 4 seconds.  

**Process:**  
Normal data sync between node 1,2,3->   
Coordinator fails ->   
Node 0 and 1 both detect failure and start election ->     
Node 1 refuse Node 0's request ->  
Node 0 ends election ->  
Node 1 won election and become coordinator ->  
Normal data sync between node 1,2  

### Simulation
#### 1. Multiple GO routines / Best case / Worst case
 These conditions are implemented inside the system. If a worker hasn't received SYNC message from the Coordinator after timeout, it will start an election no matter whether there's any ongoing election or not. This election, if fails, will be terminated by receiving either ACK or STOP message eventually.

 The following is part of a sample log in `logs_coor_fails.txt` for 4 nodes with Coordinator fails:
```
15:51:13 run.go:55: ===============START===============

...
```

#### 2. Coordinator silently leaves the network. 
Set `failcoor` = true when execute the program. This will trigger the following goroutine in `run.go`:
```
	// Simulate coordinator failure after 4 seconds
	if *fail_coordinator {
		go func() {
			time.Sleep(4 * time.Second)
			for i := range nodes {
				if nodes[i].role == COORDINATOR {
					nodes[i].fail()
					break
				}
			}
		}()
	}
```

 For the output, please refer to the previous case. 

#### 3. Worker silently leaves the network. 
Set `failworker` = true when execute the program. This will trigger the following goroutine in `run.go`:
```
	// Simulate worker failure after 4 seconds
	if *fail_worker {
		go func() {
			time.Sleep(4 * time.Second)
			for {
				random_node_idx := rand.Intn(len(nodes))
				if nodes[random_node_idx].role == WORKER {
					nodes[random_node_idx].fail()
					return
				}
			}
		}()
	}
```
 The following is a sample log in `logs_worker_fails.txt` for 4 nodes with a random worker fails:
 ```
15:53:49 run.go:55: ===============START===============
15:53:49 run.go:22: Node 1 starts to execute worker_tasks.
15:53:49 run.go:22: Node 0 starts to execute worker_tasks.
15:53:49 run.go:22: Node 2 starts to execute worker_tasks.
15:53:49 run.go:32: Node 3 starts to execute coordinator_tasks.
15:53:49 node.go:153: Node 0 received a message {}.
15:53:49 node.go:153: Node 1 received a message {}.
15:53:49 node.go:341: Coordinator 3 sent a sync message {}.
15:53:49 node.go:153: Node 2 received a message {}.
15:53:50 node.go:341: Coordinator 3 sent a sync message {}.
15:53:50 node.go:153: Node 0 received a message {}.
15:53:50 node.go:153: Node 1 received a message {}.
15:53:50 node.go:153: Node 2 received a message {}.
 ```

#### 4. The newly elected coordinator fails while announcing.
Set `failcoorvic`=true and `fail_coordinator`=true when execute the program, i.e. run command `.\run.exe -nodes=4 -sync=1 -timeout=6 -failcoor=1 -failworker=0 -failcoorvic=1` This will trigger the following goroutine in `run.go`:
```
	// Simulate coordinator candicate (newly seleted coordinator) failure duing broadcasting
	if *fail_coor_during_broadcasting {
		go func() {
			time.Sleep(4 * time.Second)
			for {
				for i := range nodes {
					if nodes[i].state == BROADCATING {
						nodes[i].coordinator_fail_during_broadcasting()
						return
					}
				}
			}
		}()
	}
```
 The following is part of a sample log in `logs_coor_fail_announcing.txt.txt` of 4 nodes:
```
22:59:48 run.go:61: ===============START===============
22:59:48 run.go:22: Node 0 starts to execute worker_tasks.
22:59:48 run.go:22: Node 2 starts to execute worker_tasks.
22:59:48 run.go:32: Node 3 starts to execute coordinator_tasks.
22:59:48 node.go:170: Node 0 received a message {}.
22:59:48 run.go:22: Node 1 starts to execute worker_tasks.
22:59:48 node.go:170: Node 1 received a message {}.
22:59:48 node.go:358: Coordinator 3 sent a sync message {}.
22:59:48 node.go:170: Node 2 received a message {}.
...
23:00:03 node.go:101: Node 2 is broadcasting a victory to 0.
23:00:03 node.go:65: Node 1 sent elect msg to 3.
23:00:03 node.go:65: Node 1 sent elect msg to 3.
23:00:03 node.go:101: Node 2 is broadcasting a victory to 1.
23:00:03 node.go:217: Node 1 received a message Node 2 is the new coordinator
23:00:03 node.go:101: Node 2 is broadcasting a victory to 3.
23:00:03 node.go:123: Node 2 fails during broadcasting.
23:00:09 node.go:195: Node 0 detected coordinator 2 failed.
23:00:09 node.go:47: Node 0 started an election.
...
23:00:15 run.go:53: Node 1 switch role.
23:00:15 run.go:32: Node 1 starts to execute coordinator_tasks.
23:00:15 node.go:170: Node 1 received a message Stop the goroutine.
23:00:15 node.go:358: Coordinator 1 sent a sync message {}.
23:00:15 node.go:170: Node 0 received a message {}.
```

Notice that this situation does not always happen due to racing between broadcasting and failure notification. 


#### 5. A node The failed node that is not the newly elected coordinator fails while announcing.
Set `failworkervic`=true and `fail_coordinator`=true when execute the program, i.e., run command `.\run.exe -nodes=3 -sync=1 -timeout=6 -failcoor=1 -failworkervic=1`.  

This will trigger the following goroutine in `run.go`:
```
// Simulate non-coordinator failure duing someone else broadcasting
	if *fail_worker_during_broadcasting {
		go func() {
			time.Sleep(4 * time.Second)
			for {
				for i := range nodes {
					if nodes[i].state == BROADCATING {
						for {
							random_node_idx := rand.Intn(len(nodes))
							if random_node_idx != i && nodes[random_node_idx].state != DOWN {
								nodes[random_node_idx].worker_fail_during_broadcasting()
								return
							}
						}
					}
				}
			}
		}()
	}
```

 20:41:43 node.go:350: Coordinator 1 sent a sync message {}.
...
```

## Others
### Issues
1. The current program usually supports <=4 nodes running, maybe due to limited computing power of my laptop or imperfectness of my implementation. Channels get stuck when too many messages arrive. Thus the next step may be to create separate channels for ELECT, ACK, VICTORY messages.
2. Some of the unexpected behaviours such as data races, delay of message transmission, etc. are not considered, especially when there are too many nodes.  

### Assumptions
1. Network is reliable.
2. Network is asynchoronous.
3. Channels won't congest. (But it actually happens when node number increases.)
