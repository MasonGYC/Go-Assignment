# Question 1
`LSPQ`: Lamport Shared Priority Queue  
`LSPQ_RA`: Lamport Shared Priority Queue with Ricart and Agrawala Optimization  
`VOTING`: Voting protocol with deadlock prevention 

## Compilation
To build:
```
go build .\LSPQ.go .\logger.go .\message.go .\PriorityQueue.go .\server.go
go build .\LSPQ_RA.go .\logger.go .\message.go .\PriorityQueue.go .\server.go
go build .\voting.go .\logger.go .\message.go .\PriorityQueue.go .\server.go 
```

To executeï¼š
```
.\LSPQ.exe -servers=? -requests=?
.\LSPQ_RA.exe -servers=? -requests=?
.\voting.exe -servers=? -requests=?
```  
- `-servers`: `int`, indicates the number of clients.  
- `-requests`: `int`, indicates the number of concurrent requests to make.   

## External package
`log` : used for output logging and debugging purpose.   
`container/heap`: used to construct priority queue.  

## Implementation
1. Priority has 2 metrics: 
	1. lamport scalar clock (smaller clock -> higher priority)
	2. node id (higher id -> higher priority)
2. Each server can only make one request at one time. If it doesn't receive all replies, it won't start making new request. 
3. Clocks are updated before the execution of a certain action.
4. If no message is received after 5 seconds, the server will stop. (timeout = 5 seconds)
5. lamport clock is used to avoid deadlock in comparison the timestamp.

## Output interpretation
The `logs.txt` in the folder contains the sample outputs with 1 - 10 clients, while all of them make request concurrently. Refer to the files for more logs.

### Sample outputs with 2 clients

# Question 2
The performance is measured on 1-10 servers making concurrent requests. The time is calculated from teh first request to all servers finished executing critical sections.
- The `performance_logs.txt` in the respective folder contains the time measured for each protocol.  

## Performance table:
unit: second  

| Number of servers | LSPQ | LSPQ_RA | VOTING |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 1 | 2.0231424 |  2.0067398 |  2.0024699 |
| 2 | 4.0298504 |  4.0206916 |  4.0278337 |
| 3 | 6.0321942 |  6.0275846 |  6.0414826 |
| 4 | 8.0714022 |  8.0280027 |  8.0508024 | 
| 5 | 10.1354729 |  10.0886073 |  10.0767158 |
| 6 | 12.0911982 |  12.1181105 |  12.0960925 |
| 7 | 14.218373 |  14.1397041 |  14.1663692 |
| 8 | 16.25372 |  16.1298288 |  16.13023 |
| 9 | 18.1930937 |  18.1006392 |  18.1623731 |
| 10 | 20.2354588 |  20.1437053 |  20.1998621 |

From the table, we can observe that generally, LSPQ is slower than VOTING, and VOTING is slower than LSPQ_RA.
